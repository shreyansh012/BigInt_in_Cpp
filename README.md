# BigInt_in_Cpp
Implementing BigInt (Big-Integer) data-type in C++ to handle really large numbers.

Big Integer in C++ language.

The maximum limit of unsigned long long in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615 , a 20 digit Number. While languages like Java supportsupport classes of Big Integer. C++ by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C/C++ language. Here we can handle numbers having more than 20 digits.

The program is implemented using classes and operator overloading to performs various operations like +, -, * and / .

We can performs operations like:

1.Addition.

2.Subtraction.

3.Multiplication of two large numbers.

4.Division.

5.Power of a large number.

6.Factorial of a number.

-> The program can be further included as a header in any other program to directly use the bigint datatype and perform large operations.
